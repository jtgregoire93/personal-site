Documentation is a WIP lol

Requirements: 
- latest version of RStudio 
- a Github account (if you don't have one, see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account))
- install the tidyverse, glue, and googlesheets4 packages from cran. 

Steps: 
- make sure you install the libraries used in t
- make a copy of this [sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AwKkvT2OnWBlp38iTHF4nglzu67B_NMSgpf0ZhdEiB4/edit?usp=sharing) and fill out your own information ([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLnOdTkLmNy7c08_61NGYS2AlOt5fgqfPGmnKRW0pdM/edit?usp=sharing) is mine for reference if you don't understand how to fill out the sheet)
- when you have some info in the sheet, go ahead and test that it works. Fork this repo to your github account, and open the resume .Rproj file in RStudio.
- update the resume.Rmd params as follows: 
  - sheet_id the id of your google sheet, or just the entire url 
  - replace the online link with the path to the resume repo now forked to your github account, something like `https://[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME].github.io/resume`. If it doesn't work, that is fine. We will make sure you get github pages set up in the last step. 
  - replace the pdf_location with `https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/resume/raw/main/resume.pdf`. If the path to your resume repo is a sub directory, make sure you update to the correct path from your github account. the raw field just directs to the download path for the PDF file, and the main part of the path just references the branch from which you host your github page. If either is different, update the previous 2 paths as needed. 
  - Follow the steps to create a github pages site once everything is pushed from your local environment. This will be found in the Setting of the resume repo you just created. Follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
